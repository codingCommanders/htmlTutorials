    <h1>&sext; Bug-fighting Supplies &sext;</h1>
    <p class = 'justMe'>Hello Coding Commander!  This page displays the bug-fighting supplies in our squad's inventory.  The page is designed to help you and your squad plan for bug attacks.  There are recomended uses for each tool.  We want all our Coding Commanders and Coding Cadets to get the most out of all avilable resources.</p>
    <br><br>
    <div class ='borderMe'>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bug Spray:</strong> Everyone (resistance fighers & civilians) should have a bottle of bug spray.  You have to be within 20 feet of the bug for the spray to be effective.</li><br>
        <li><strong>TNT:</strong> If there are 20 or more bugs attacking, we recommend using the TNT.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Laptops:</strong> Every Coding Commander and Coding Cadet should be rmed with a lap top.  Web Development is our most powerful weapon against the bugs.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Arrows:</strong> Those on the front lines should be trained in archery.  Arrows are inexpensive and easy to produce.</li>
      </ul>
